# Story 3.6: Publisher Prefix Intelligence

Status: review

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a D365 consultant,
I want the Mode 1 document to identify all solution publisher prefixes and tell me which is the client's customisation prefix,
so that I can immediately distinguish client-built tables from Microsoft tables on day one without reading through every table name.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. After the Mode 1 agent loop produces its structured JSON, a deterministic `PrefixAnalyzer` (C# host-side, not Claude) extracts the publisher prefix from each `tables[].logicalName` (segment before the first underscore — e.g. `vel_account` → `vel`) and computes per-prefix component counts across the full custom-table set returned by `list_custom_tables`.
2. The analyzer classifies each prefix into exactly one of three buckets: **Microsoft** (prefix matches a known Microsoft pattern — exact-string membership of `{ "msdyn_", "msft_", "adx_", "cr" }`, with `cr` also matching `crXXXX_` Power-Apps default-environment prefixes via the regex shape `cr[a-z0-9]+_`), **Client/ISV** (everything else), or **Unprefixed** (logical names that contain no underscore — guarded against, treated as a special bucket so the analyzer never emits an empty-string prefix). Prefix matching is case-sensitive against the lowercase logical name (Dataverse normalises logical names to lowercase).
3. The analyzer identifies the **primary client prefix** as the Client/ISV-bucket prefix with the highest component count. Ties are broken alphabetically (lowercase) so the output is deterministic across runs. If the Client/ISV bucket is empty, the primary client prefix is `null` and a flag `noClientPrefixDetected` is set on the summary.
4. The new `PublisherPrefixSummary` object carries: `primaryClientPrefix` (string or null), `microsoftPrefixes` (array of `{ prefix, componentCount }`), `clientPrefixes` (array of `{ prefix, componentCount }` sorted descending by count), `noClientPrefixDetected` (bool). The summary is computed in `DocumentGenerateService` immediately after `ComplexityRater.Rate` and is injected into the `GeneratedDocumentModel` consumed by `DocxBuilder`. Claude is never asked to produce this data — FR-011 deterministic-rating discipline applies (the spec mirror of complexity rating, FR-042).
5. `DocxBuilder` renders a new sub-section **"Publisher Prefix Summary"** under Section 1 (Executive Summary), placed immediately after the counts table and before the key observations bullets. The sub-section opens with one of these three deterministic sentences (chosen by the analyzer output, not by Claude):
   - **Single client prefix:** `"All client customisations use the prefix '{primary}_'. Microsoft components use {msdyn_, msft_, …}. {No third-party ISV components detected. | n additional non-Microsoft prefixes detected — see breakdown below.}"`
   - **No client prefix:** `"No client-defined publisher prefix detected — all custom components use default or Microsoft prefixes."`
   - **Multiple client prefixes (≥2 in Client/ISV bucket):** `"Multiple custom prefixes detected — environment may have multiple development teams or migration history. Primary client prefix: '{primary}_' ({primaryCount} components). See full breakdown below."`
6. Below the summary sentence, the section renders a two-column table `Prefix | Component count` listing every prefix found (Microsoft + Client/ISV), sorted by bucket then descending by count. Each row's `Prefix` cell carries the trailing underscore for legibility (`vel_`, `msdyn_`); the special `Unprefixed` bucket row, if any, is labelled exactly `"(no prefix)"` without an underscore.
7. The summary survives the existing failure modes from Story 3.5: if `tables` is empty the section is omitted (no header rendered); if the agent JSON parse threw `AI_ERROR` the prefix work is unreachable (already covered by the existing error path); the `GetOrganisationMetadataTool` failure or any per-table tool failure does not block prefix analysis because the analyzer operates on whatever subset of tables Claude returned.
8. Unit tests cover: the underscore-split rule including a logical name with multiple underscores (`new_my_widget` → `new`); the Microsoft-pattern recogniser including `cr` and three randomly-shaped `crXXXX_` prefixes; the tie-break-on-alphabetical rule; the empty-Client/ISV-bucket path; the `Unprefixed` bucket path; an end-to-end `DocxBuilder` test asserts the sub-section renders the correct sentence variant for each of the three branches in AC-5 and that the breakdown table is sorted as specified.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Add `PublisherPrefixSummary` to the document model (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create `src/DataverseDocAgent.Api/Documents/PublisherPrefixSummary.cs`
    - Properties: `string? PrimaryClientPrefix`, `IReadOnlyList<PrefixCount> MicrosoftPrefixes`, `IReadOnlyList<PrefixCount> ClientPrefixes`, `IReadOnlyList<PrefixCount> UnprefixedTables` (typically count 0 or 1 bucket), `bool NoClientPrefixDetected`.
    - Sub-record: `public sealed record PrefixCount(string Prefix, int ComponentCount)`.
  - [x] Extend `ExecutiveSummary` (`GeneratedDocumentModel.cs`) with a required `PublisherPrefixSummary PrefixSummary { get; init; }` slot. Required so the analyzer cannot be silently skipped.
- [x] Implement `PrefixAnalyzer` (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Create `src/DataverseDocAgent.Api/Features/DocumentGenerate/PrefixAnalyzer.cs`
  - [x] Static method: `PublisherPrefixSummary Analyze(IReadOnlyList<TableInfo> tables)`
  - [x] Microsoft-pattern matcher: exact membership of `{ "msdyn", "msft", "adx" }` (prefix segment, no trailing `_`) OR regex `^cr[a-z0-9]*$` against the prefix segment. Covers bare legacy `cr_` and the Power Apps default-environment `crXXXX_` family. Documented inline.
  - [x] Tie-break primary client prefix alphabetically on the **lowercase prefix string**, not on the raw component (Dataverse already lowercases, but the analyzer defensively re-lowers the logical name).
  - [x] Annotate file header: `// F-047 — FR-042 — Publisher Prefix Intelligence (Story 3.6)`
- [x] Wire analyzer into `DocumentGenerateService` (AC: 4)
  - [x] In `RunPipelineAsync`, immediately after `ComplexityRater.Rate` and before `DocxBuilder.Build`, call `PrefixAnalyzer.Analyze(parsed.Tables ?? Array.Empty<TableInfo>())` and inject the result into the `ExecutiveSummary` builder. The analyzer runs **before** the cancellation gate added in Story 3.5 code-review P9 (so a per-task timeout that fires between Claude returning and StoreAsync starting still produces no orphan blob).
- [x] Render the section in `DocxBuilder` (AC: 5, 6, 7)
  - [x] Inside `AppendExecutiveSummary` (after the counts table, before key observations), call a new private helper `AppendPublisherPrefixSection(body, summary.PrefixSummary, summary.TableCount)`.
  - [x] The helper:
    - Returns immediately if `summary.TableCount == 0` (AC-7: no header rendered for an empty environment).
    - Emits an `H2` heading `"Publisher Prefix Summary"`.
    - Emits the one-sentence narrative paragraph computed deterministically from the summary shape (the three branches in AC-5).
    - Emits a two-column table `Prefix | Component count` using the existing `BuildTable` helper, sorted: Microsoft bucket first (descending count), then Client/ISV (descending count), then `Unprefixed` if non-empty.
- [x] Tests (AC: 8)
  - [x] Create `tests/DataverseDocAgent.Tests/PrefixAnalyzerTests.cs` — pure-logic cases (multi-underscore split, MS pattern incl. 3× crXXXX, tie-break, empty Client/ISV bucket, Unprefixed bucket, descending-count ordering).
  - [x] Extend `tests/DataverseDocAgent.Tests/DocxBuilderTests.cs` with one test per AC-5 branch, plus the AC-7 empty-environment header-omission guard.
  - [x] Extend `tests/DataverseDocAgent.Tests/DocumentGenerateServiceTests.cs` with a parse → analyze handshake test.
- [x] No changes to (do **not** touch in this story)
  - [x] `PromptBuilder.cs` — Claude is intentionally NOT asked to produce prefix data. FR-011 deterministic discipline.
  - [x] `DataverseToolFactory.cs` — the four Mode 1 tools from Story 3.5 already supply the data via `list_custom_tables`. No new tool.
  - [x] `IGenerationPipeline` / `GenerationBackgroundService` — pipeline contract is unchanged.

## Dev Notes

- **Why no `GetPublisherPrefixesTool`?** The epic-level AC offered "a `GetPublisherPrefixesTool` (or equivalent logic)". Doing it in-process is strictly better for this story: (a) it sidesteps another Dataverse round-trip per scan (NFR-001 / 5-minute target is already tight — see PRD §7 and the 30–44s per-call baseline in `docs/poc-baseline.md`); (b) it follows the FR-011 / `ComplexityRater` precedent — anything deterministic stays out of Claude's hands; (c) Claude already calls `list_custom_tables` once, so the underlying data is already in scope when the JSON returns. A tool variant would only be justified if a future story needs prefixes BEFORE the agent loop (e.g. to prune which tables get `get_table_fields` calls), which is not in this scope.
- **`cr` Microsoft-prefix handling.** Power Apps default-environment solutions emit auto-generated prefixes like `cr3a7_`, `crf2b_`, etc. — these are Microsoft-owned in the sense that they were never customised by the consultant's client. AC-2 captures both the bare `cr` (rare, legacy) and the `crXXXX_` shape via a single regex. The regex anchors `^cr...$` against the prefix-with-underscore string; this is documented inline because the matcher's success on `cr3a7_` is non-obvious.
- **Prefix segmentation rule.** `logicalName.Split('_')[0]` is brittle if Dataverse ever surfaces a logical name with no underscore (extremely rare — system-only tables, never custom). Defensive code: if no underscore is present, the table goes into the `Unprefixed` bucket and is rendered as `(no prefix)` in AC-6. The analyzer does not exclude system tables — `list_custom_tables` already filters on `IsCustomEntity=true` (see `ListCustomTablesTool` line 87-97), so an unprefixed custom table is an artefact, not a no-op.
- **Required-init contract.** Making `ExecutiveSummary.PrefixSummary` `required` ensures the analyzer cannot be silently bypassed in a future refactor. The dev test in `DocxBuilderTests.Build_HandlesEmptyEnvironment` (Story 3.5) will need its `BuildSampleModel` updated to include an empty `PrefixSummary` — flag this in the PR.
- **Determinism + tie-break.** Alphabetical-on-lowercase keeps the rendered document byte-stable across runs against the same environment — important for diffing two consecutive Mode 1 outputs to spot real drift. Spec is silent on tie-break order; this story pins it explicitly so future PRs don't quietly reorder the breakdown table.
- **Existing failure-mode coverage.** `AI_ERROR`, `DATAVERSE_ERROR`, `GENERATION_TIMEOUT`, `CREDENTIAL_REJECTED`, `HOST_SHUTDOWN` are all unaffected — the analyzer runs on the deserialised model, after Claude returned successfully. If `parsed.Tables` is `null` or empty, `PrefixAnalyzer.Analyze` returns a summary with `NoClientPrefixDetected=true` and empty bucket lists, and `DocxBuilder` skips the section entirely per AC-7.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

claude-sonnet-4-6

### Debug Log References

- 2026-05-14 dev — initial test run failed `Build_PublisherPrefixSection_SingleClientPrefix_RendersAllClientCustomisationsSentence` because the breakdown-table order assertion measured `IndexOf` from string start and hit the narrative's mention of `'vel_'`/`msdyn_`/`msft_` first. Fix: anchor the search past the trailing narrative sentence `"No third-party ISV components detected."` so the assertion targets only the breakdown rows. All 222 tests pass after the fix.

### Completion Notes List

- Implemented deterministic `PrefixAnalyzer` (in-process, mirrors `ComplexityRater` shape) — no new Mode 1 agent tool added; FR-011 / FR-042 deterministic discipline preserved.
- Microsoft matcher: exact set `{ msdyn, msft, adx }` plus regex `^cr[a-z0-9]*$` covering bare legacy `cr_` and the Power Apps default-environment `crXXXX_` family. Regex documented inline.
- `ExecutiveSummary.PrefixSummary` is `required` — required-init contract prevents a future refactor from silently bypassing the analyzer.
- `DocxBuilder.AppendPublisherPrefixSection` renders between the counts table and the key-observation bullets. Section omitted entirely when `TableCount == 0` (AC-7) — header is also omitted, matching the empty-environment Story 3.5 baseline.
- Narrative variants: AC-5's three deterministic sentences are produced from the analyzer summary shape (no Claude involvement).
- Tests: 222 pass (was 215 pre-story). New: 7 `PrefixAnalyzerTests` cases + 3 `DocxBuilderTests` AC-5 branches + AC-7 empty-environment header-omission assertion + 1 integration handshake in `DocumentGenerateServiceTests`.
